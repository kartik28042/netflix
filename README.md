The main goal of analyzing this Netflix dataset is to gain insights into the types of content available on the platform, understand viewing trends, and explore patterns related to movies and TV shows. 
Specifically, I want to:
1.	Identify Content Trends: Analyze which genres, ratings, and content types (movies vs. TV shows) are most popular based on release years and availability.
2.	Explore Director and Cast Influence: Investigate whether certain directors or cast members are associated with higher-rated content or specific genres.
3.	Understand Global Reach: Examine the distribution of content by country to identify how Netflix caters to different international markets.
4.	Duration Patterns: Analyze the duration of content (in terms of seasons for TV shows and length for movies) to see trends in binge-worthy or short-form content.
   
By achieving these goals, I aim to develop better data analysis skills, improve my understanding of content distribution on streaming platforms, and use SQL to extract valuable insights from real-world datasets.
